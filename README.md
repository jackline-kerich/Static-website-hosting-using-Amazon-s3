üåê How to Host a Simple Static Website on AWS S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is ideal for hosting static websites because it serves files directly to users without requiring server-side processing. Static websites consist of fixed content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets ‚Äî all delivered exactly as stored. Unlike dynamic sites, S3 doesn‚Äôt support back-end logic but provides a cost-effective, scalable, and reliable storage solution for delivering static content such as personal websites, landing pages, or documentation.
